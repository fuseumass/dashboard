# Hackathon Dashboard
(A HackUMass application)

This is Hackathon Dashboard a Ruby on Rails web app used for registration, hardware inventory, hardware checkouts, mentorship, check in, and everything else you would need at a Hackathon.

In order to run Hackathon Dashboard you will need development:
* Rails 5.1.4
* Ruby 2.5

### Open Source Status
Not ready. We need to:
- [ ] Remove private keys and replace with ENV variables
- [ ] Update documentation(last updated summer 2017)
- [ ] Finishing updating the web app to Tabler UI
- [ ] Clean up to securely have a 2 step deployment for other hackathons.
