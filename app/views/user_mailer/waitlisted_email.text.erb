Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,

Registration for this year’s event was really competitive and although we wish we could give everyone a spot, that just isn’t the case. As of right now, you’re application has been waitlisted. This means that there is still a possibility you might get a seat, but no guarantees.

We’ll send you an email if we have any updates.

Thanks for showing an interest in our hackathon,
HackUMass team.
