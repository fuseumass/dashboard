Hi <%= @user.first_name %>

Registration for this year’s event was really competitive and although we wish we could give everyone a spot, that just isn’t the case. We’re sorry to inform you that this year we weren’t able to give yo a seat in our hackathon.

However that doesn’t mean that you can’t join us next year.

Thanks for showing an interest in our hackathon,
HackUMass team.
