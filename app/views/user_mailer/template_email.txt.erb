Hello <%= @user.first_name %>,

We wanted to inform you of an opportunity to attend HackUMass without a RSVP. A number of you emailed us regarding your interest in attending despite missing the RSVP deadline, and we’ve heard your requests. Unfortunately, due to limitations with our venue we are unable to simply accept all of you. However, what we can do is the following:

Please come to the HackUMass registration table in the Campus Center at 6:00pm on Friday November 3rd. If we have enough space, we will accept everyone who shows up on a first come first served basis until we run out of space in our venue.

Thanks for sticking with us throughout this admittedly rough RSVP process this year. We hope that you’re able to attend, and we can’t wait to see you on Friday.

Sincerely,
The HackUMass Team
