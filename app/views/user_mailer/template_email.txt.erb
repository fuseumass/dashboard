HackUMass is happening this Friday! This is the last email you will receive before the event, all communication from now on will be happening through Slack, so make sure to join through our website.

We have gotten a few emails from people letting us know that they won’t be able to make it. We understand stuff happens, so if you can’t come to the event please head out to our website and click the “Sorry I Can’t Participate” button. By clicking this button you are declining your invite and your application will be denied.

After lots of requests, hardware is officially released! Head out to our website and click on the Hardware tab to checkout over 100 hardware items that we got for you. Along with Hardware, our prize list is also available. Now you have everything you need in order to start thinking of your strategy for the hackathon.

Additionally, pickup locations and times for New York and Boston buses are also available on our website.
