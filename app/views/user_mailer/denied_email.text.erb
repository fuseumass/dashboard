Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,

Thanks for applying to <%= HackumassWeb::Application::HACKATHON_NAME %>. Unfortunately we don’t have enough room to accommodate everyone who wants to participate and we’ve had to reject your application. We hope that you’ll continue your enthusiasm for hacking and apply to other awesome hackathons (you can find a list at https://mlh.io/seasons/na-2018/events).

Thanks again for applying to <%= HackumassWeb::Application::HACKATHON_NAME %>, and we hope that you’ll apply again next year.

- The <%= HackumassWeb::Application::HACKATHON_NAME %> Team
