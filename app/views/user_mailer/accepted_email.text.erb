Hello <%= @user.first_name %>,
  
Congratulations! You’ve been accepted to participate in HackUMass. 

The event is from November 3rd to November 5th 2017 at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  In order to participate, make sure you go to our website and RSVP!

Even though we would like to help everyone get to HackUMass, we simply don’t have enough funds. Because of this, travel reimbursements will not be offered.

If you have any questions please visit our website at www.hackumass.com. If you can’t find your answer on our website, then please feel free to shoot us an email at team@hackumass.com and we’ll get back to you as soon as we can.
