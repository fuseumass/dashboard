        <div class="text-muted">We partnered with Bus.com to provide buses to and from the event.  Because we want to make sure that reserved seats are used, you will be charged $5 in order to reserve a seat on the bus. We will reimburse the $5 after the event is over. In the case that you reserve a seat on the bus and do not attend the event, the $5 will not be reimbursed. </div>
